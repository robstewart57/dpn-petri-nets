* Motivation

The ongoing dataflow transformations paper describes why deterministic
actors are easier to transform than potentially non-determinstic
actors. This is repeated here in Table
\ref{tab:dpn-non-determinism-analysis}, from the CAL standard library
of over a thousand actors. So whilst it is good to parallelise
stateless actors, to increase coverage of transformations, actors with
internal non-trivial scheduling inside should also be considered.
Scheduling of firing rules inside actors is governed by a FSM.

Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0023756} offer
analysis approaches and definitions for concurrent systems. I think
that CPN reasoning can be used to analysis FSMs within DPN actors. We
can borrow the CPN terminology in the transformations paper, and
potentially we can implement the CPN analysis and transformation
techniques within DPN actors, to enable DPN transformations.

An example of a simple CPN is in Table [[cpn-example]]. It shows 3 places:
/Data Received, B/ and /C/. The colour type for place /B/ is the type
product of ~NO~, which is a number type, and ~DATA~, which in this
example is a String. A CPN marking is the state of a DPN, with data
tokens sitting at places, at which point enabled transitions are
known. In marking $M_0$, there are 2 tokens at /B/: /(1,"COL")/ and
/(2,"OUR")/. Two transitions are enabled: /Discard Packet/ and
/Receive Next/. They are guarded on the ~NO~ number value, ~n<>k~ and
~n=k~ respectively.


* Notation

A CPN is a tuple $N = (P, T, A, \Sigma, C, N, E, G, I )$ where:

- $P$ is a set of places.
  - *DPN mapping* I propose two place kinds: input/output port places,
    and FSM states. FSM places are used to pass around the set of
    global state variables.
- $T$ is a set of transitions.
  - *DPN mapping* transitions are CAL actions.
- $A$ is a set of arcs.
  - *DPN mapping* arcs pass tokens between /port/ places and
    transitions, and pass the set of global actor variables between
    /FSM/ places and transitions.
- $\Sigma$ is a set of color sets.
  - *DPN mapping* this is a product of the set of global variable
    types and the set of input port types.
- $C$ is a color function. It maps places in $P$ into colours in
  $\Sigma$.
  - *DPN mapping* assigns types to places according to the input ports
    they consume from, and if the global variable set is non-empty,
    then the set of global variable types also.
- $N$ is a node function. It maps $A$ into $(P \times T) \cup (T
  \times P)$.
  - *DPN mapping* connects all $t \in T$ to their input port and input
    FSM places.
- $E$ is an arc expression function. It maps each arc $a \in A$ into
  the expression $e$.
  - *DPN mapping* for arcs to output port places, the computation
    applied to the transition's inputs. for arcs to FSM places, a list
    of modifications to the set of global actor variables.
- $G$ is a guard function. It maps each transition $t \in T$ to a
  guard expression $g$.
  - *DPN mapping* are guards attached to actions.
- $I$ is an initialization function. It maps each place $p$ into an
  initialization expression $i$.

* CAL Actors to CPNs

The two examples below shows the translation from DPN to CPN using the
proposed scheme. Here's a software prototype that parses a CAL actor
file, and outputs a visual CPN showing its scheduling.

** One action and no global variables

Here is an example of a CAL actor with one action (transition) and no
global state:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
actor OnePureAction () bool in1 ==> bool out1 :
  act1: action in1:[x] ==> out1:[x+1] end
  schedule fsm s0 :
    s0 (act1) --> s0;
  end
end
#+END_EXAMPLE

The tool turns that actor into the CPN below. It has 2 /port/ places,
one /FSM/ place, one transition corresponding to the action /act1/.
The set of global variables is the empty set, passes back and forth
to the /s0/ FSM place and the /act1/ transition.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
#+CAPTION: One action transitions and no global variables
[[./images/one-action.png]]

** Two actions and one global variable

This actor has a global variable set of $\{bl\}$, where $bl$ is a
global variable of type ~bool~. The FSM enforces a firing schedule
alternating transitions ~act1~ and ~act2~.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
actor TwoStatefulActions () int(size=8) in1, int(size=8) in2
                            ==> int(size=8) out1, int(size=8) out2 :
  bool bl := false;
  act1: action in1:[x] ==> out1:[x+1]
    guard (not bl)
    do bl := not bl;
  end
  act2: action in2:[x] ==> out2:[x-2]
    guard bl
    do bl := not bl; end
  schedule fsm s0 :
    s0 (act1) --> s1;
    s1 (act2) --> s0;
  end
end
#+END_EXAMPLE

The tool turns that actor into the CPN below. It has 2 /FSM/ places
and 4 /port/ places. The two transitions /act1/ and /act2/ are guarded
on the value of the global variable ~bl~, carried inwards from /FSM/
places as ~st~. In this case, this scheduling is anyway enforced by
the explicit FSM in the CAL code. The arcs from transitions to /FSM/
places are annotated with statements from within those transition
computations that modify the values of global variables, in this case
~bl~.

** Finding the brightest pixel in an image

This actor has a global variable set of $\{max, pixelsCounted\}$,
where /max/ keeps track of the largest pixel value and /pixelsCounted/
keeps track of how many pixels from the incoming $512\times512$ image
have been consumed. The guard on the /fold/ action forces the
eventual transition to /s1/, which immediately resets the actor to
/s0/ with the /reset/ action.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
actor MaxPixel () uint(size=8) in1 ==> uint(size=8) out1 :
  uint(size=8) max := 0;
  int(size=32) pixelsCounted := 0;

  fold: action in1:[x] ==>
  guard (pixelsCounts < 512 * 512)
  do max := if x > max then x else max end;
     pixelsCounted := 0;
  end
  
  reset: action ==> out1:[max]
  do pixelsCounted := 0;
  end

  schedule fsm s0 :
    s0 (fold)  --> s0;
    s0 (fold)  --> s1;
    s1 (reset) --> s0;
  end
end
#+END_EXAMPLE

The corresponding CPN for this DPN actor is:

* CPN terminology

Here is some terminology to categorise CPNs, and how we may wish to
classify scheduling in CAL actors:

- An /occurrence sequence/ is the intermediate markings reached from
  initial marking $M_0$ and $M_n$ after $n$ steps.
- A /dead/ marking is one where there are no enabled transitions.
- A /double-headed/ arc is short hand for the situation where there
  are two oppositely directed arcs between a place and a transition
  sharing the same arc expression.
- A transition without an input place is a /source transition/, i.e. a
  CAL action that does not consume from input ports and its actor has
  no global variables.
- A transition without an output place is a /sink transition/.
- A pair of a place $p$ and a transition $t$ is called a /self-loop/
  is $p$ is both an input and an output place of $t$. This is true for
  actors with only a single action, where that transitions repeatedly
  returns to $s0$.
- An /infinite capacity/ CPN is one with no limit on the number of
  data tokens in places, in our case /port/ places. A /finite
  capacity/ CPN is one with capacities attached to port places. This
  is our model --- we must specific FIFO depths in DPN graphs.
- A CPN with places with exactly one incoming and one outgoing arc is
  called a /marked graph/.

* CPN analysis

The motivation for mapping DPN actors to CPNs is to identify which DPN
actors can be transformed.

- *Reachability* A marking is /reachable/ if there are a set of
  transitions from $M_0$ to it. The set of possible marking reachable
  from $M_0$ is denoted $R(M_0)$. The reachability problem is finding
  $M_n~\in~R(M_0)$ for a given marking $M_n$.
- *Liveness* ensures that CPN (and hence DPN actors) do not deadlock,
  no matter what firing sequence is chosen. A CPN is live if, which
  ever marking has been reached from $M_0$, it is possible to
  ultimately fire any transition in the CPN. It is further
  categorised:
  1. L0-live (dead) if transition /t/ can never be fired in any firing
     sequence in $L(M_0)$.
  2. L1-live (potentially fireable) if /t/ can be fired at least once
     in some firing sequence in $L(M_0)$.
  3. L2-live if, given a positive integer /k/, /t/ can be fired at
     least /k/ times.
  4. L4-live (live) if /t/ is L1-live for every marking $M$ in
     $R(M_0)$.
- *Reversability* A CPN is reversible if, for every marking M in
  $R(M_0)$, $M_0$ is reachable from $M$. Thus, in a reversible net,
  one can always get back to the initial marking or state.
- *Persistence* A CPN is persistent if, for any two enabled
  transitions, the firing of one transition will not disable the
  other. A transition in a persistent net, once it is enabled, will
  stay enabled until it fires $\footnote{a very useful property for
  identifying opportunities for preemptive parallel scheduling, though
  not our case due to the DPN sequentially semantics of actors}$.
- *Fairness* Two transitions have a /bound-fair/ relation if the
  maximum number of times that either one can fire with the other is
  not firing is bounded. A CPN is /B-fair/ if every pair of transition
  in the net are in a /B-fair/ relation.
- *Determinstism* A CPN is /deterministic/ iff:
  1. only one transition is enabled at each marking.
  2. each transition has one binding.
  3. there is only one possible occurrence sequence $M_0$, $M_1$ ..
     $M_n$. For our transformations, we assume actors always
     eventually become fireable, /i.e./ is discount any CPNs with the
     possibility of reaching /dead/ markings, meaning that
     determinstic CPNs are ones with an occurrence sequence from $M_0$
     back to $M_0$.

Non-deterministic CPNs introduce issues of concurrency and conflict,
and preliminary analysis of CAL actor code shows us that the majority
of actor in the CAL standard library can be translated to
non-deterministic CPNs.

* Our distinctions compared to CPN analysis

Our treatment of CPNs for DPN analysis differs from CPN literature in
one important way. CPN can be used for potential identifying multiple
transitions that can fire in the same step from marking $M_n$ to
$M_{n+1}$. The semantics of DPN actor enforces sequentiality, i.e.
only one action can fire, and until the control flow exits the body of
that action, all other actions are disabled. In the DPN model,
parallelism comes from connecting multiple actors together (the "wire"
being the one parallelism construct in the language), no parallelism
occurs inside actors.

A limitation in this CPN $\rightarrow$ DPN approach is that it reasons
about actors in isolation. That is, the data arriving at input port
places are not delivered by external stimuli. Marking $M_0$ must have
data tokens at least one input port place (unless the CPN has source
transitions, Section [[CPN terminology]]), /e.g./

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1`(1) 1`(3) 2`(5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

At a port place /In1/ would say there is 1 token with value 1, 1 token
with value 3, and 2 tokens with value 5. This often isn't a problem
for CAL actors --- the firing of many actions is /not/ guarded by the
value of tokens, or disambiguated by the presence of tokens at one
input port over another. Instead, firing is very often determined by
explicit FSM written by the programmer, or by guards on global
variable values. The true power of dyanism, such as disambiguating
action choice based on the availability of data at one input port over
another, or the values of incoming tokens, is often not used in
practise by CAL programmers (which is good in terms of actor analysis
and transformation).

A far more ambitious project would compose the CPN description of DPN
actors together, thus connecting output port places to input port
places.

My interpretation of CPN places is that they are /bags/, i.e.
unordered collections of possibly duplicate tokens. In the DPN world,
data tokens in port places must be ordered, because dataflow wires
feed them in a FIFO fashion.

* Desirable CPN properties for DPN actor transformations

Using CPN terminology and analysis approaches, we would probably find
it easier to identify DPN actor transformations when:

- There are no /dead/ markings.
- A CPN has a /self-loop/ from a single FSM state to a single action.
- All markings are /reachable/.
- The CPN is /L4-live/.
- The CPN is /reversible/ back to the enabled transition at $M_0$.
- All actions are /persistent/.
- The CPN is /B-fair/.

The simplest DPN actor to consider for transformation is one with one
action and no global variables. The second simplest is ones that have
/deterministic/ CPN representations using our mapping (Section [[CPN
analysis]]), and identifying /CPN-determinstic/ DPN actors should be our
next step for new transformation designs.


* Changes to this DPN to CPN mapping?

This document proposes one way to map DPN actors to Colour Petri Nets.
There are probably many other mappings. One I'd thought about is to
have just one /place/ for all ports, rather than one place per port,
and using colour types to distinguish which port tokens are at. E.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1`(In1,1)
4`(In1,2)
6`(In2,2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

at one place says that there is 1 token with value 1 at actor input
port /In1/, 4 tokens with value 2 at input port /In1/, and 6 tokens
with value 2 at input port /In2/.

I'm not sure which is better: one place per port, or one place for all
ports, using colour types to distinguish ports.
